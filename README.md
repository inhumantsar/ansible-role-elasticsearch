# elasticsearch

## What?

Starts Elasticsearch (plus Kibana and Logstash optionally) in Docker Swarm using a docker-compose file.

## Why?

Docker Swarm isn't supported by Ansible yet, but there are [pull](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19229) [requests](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/24588)) out there, and there's demand, so it shouldn't be long. Hopefully.

## How?
